AUCA BIG DATA ANALYTICS FINAL PROJECT
PART 1: MONGODB IMPLEMENTATION
============================================================

Generated: 2026-01-27 19:50:53

METHODOLOGY:
- MongoDB accessed via Docker commands using authentication
- Aggregation queries executed using mongosh
- Results parsed and saved to JSON format
- Sample CSV files created for visualization

QUERY 1: TOP-SELLING PRODUCTS
========================================
Objective: Identify the 10 best-selling products by quantity sold

Aggregation Pipeline:
[
  {"$unwind": "$items"},
  {"$group": {
    "_id": "$items.product_id",
    "totalSold": {"$sum": "$items.quantity"}
  }},
  {"$sort": {"totalSold": -1}},
  {"$limit": 10}
]

Business Value:
- Inventory optimization
- Stock replenishment planning
- Product performance analysis

Results: Saved in 'query1_top_products.json'

QUERY 2: REVENUE BY CATEGORY
========================================
Objective: Calculate total revenue generated by each product category

Aggregation Pipeline:
[
  {"$unwind": "$items"},
  {"$lookup": {
    "from": "products",
    "localField": "items.product_id",
    "foreignField": "product_id",
    "as": "product"
  }},
  {"$unwind": "$product"},
  {"$group": {
    "_id": "$product.category_id",
    "totalRevenue": {"$sum": "$items.subtotal"}
  }},
  {"$sort": {"totalRevenue": -1}}
]

Business Value:
- Category performance analysis
- Marketing strategy development
- Resource allocation optimization

Results: Saved in 'query2_revenue_by_category.json'

MONGODB DATA MODELING DECISIONS:
========================================
1. Document Model Selection:
   - Chosen for nested structures (transaction items array)
   - Flexible schema accommodates evolving data requirements
   - Embedded documents reduce join operations

2. Collection Design:
   - users: User profiles and demographics
   - products: Product catalog with pricing
   - categories: Hierarchical product classification
   - transactions: Sales transactions with embedded items

3. Schema Design:
   - Transactions embed line items for performance
   - Products reference categories via category_id
   - Users tracked with unique user_id
   - Timestamps for temporal analysis

4. Indexing Strategy:
   - transactions: Index on timestamp, user_id, items.product_id
   - products: Index on product_id, category_id
   - users: Index on user_id
   - categories: Index on category_id

WHY MONGODB FOR E-COMMERCE ANALYTICS:
========================================
1. Document Flexibility: Accommodates varying product attributes
2. Nested Structures: Perfect for transaction line items
3. Aggregation Framework: Powerful analytics capabilities
4. Scalability: Horizontal scaling for growing data volumes
5. Performance: Fast reads for real-time analytics

FILES GENERATED:
========================================
JSON Files (Raw Query Results):
- query1_top_products.json
- query2_revenue_by_category.json
- query3_sample_data.json

CSV Files (For Visualization - Sample Data):
- top_products.csv
- revenue_by_category.csv
- daily_revenue.csv

BUSINESS INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
========================================
1. Product Strategy:
   - Focus marketing on top-selling products
   - Consider bundling popular items
   - Monitor inventory for high-demand products

2. Category Management:
   - Allocate more resources to high-revenue categories
   - Consider promotions for underperforming categories
   - Analyze seasonal trends by category

3. Customer Insights:
   - Segment customers by purchase behavior
   - Implement personalized recommendations
   - Develop loyalty programs

4. Operational Improvements:
   - Optimize inventory based on sales patterns
   - Improve shipping for high-volume products
   - Streamline category management

LIMITATIONS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
========================================
1. Real-time Analytics: Implement streaming for live data
2. Advanced ML: Product recommendations using machine learning
3. Geographic Analysis: Sales patterns by region
4. Customer Lifetime Value: Predictive modeling
5. Integration: Connect with other data sources (social media, reviews)
