ANALYTICS INTEGRATION REPORT
===============================
Generated: 2026-01-28 15:19:56

OVERVIEW:
This report demonstrates the integration of MongoDB, HBase, and Spark
for comprehensive e-commerce analytics.

INTEGRATED QUERIES EXECUTED:

1. CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (CLV) ESTIMATION
-------------------------------------------
Sources: MongoDB (transactions) + HBase (sessions) + Spark (analytics)
Purpose: Predict long-term customer value
Method: CLV = (Avg Purchase x Frequency x Lifespan) + Engagement Score
Business Value: Customer segmentation, marketing budget allocation

2. PRODUCT AFFINITY & RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------------------
Sources: MongoDB (purchases) + HBase (browsing) + Spark (ML)
Purpose: Personalized product recommendations
Method: Collaborative filtering + Association rule mining
Business Value: Increased sales through cross-selling

3. FUNNEL CONVERSION ANALYSIS
-----------------------------
Sources: HBase (session flow) + MongoDB (transactions)
Purpose: Identify conversion bottlenecks
Method: Track user journey through purchase stages
Business Value: Website optimization, reduced cart abandonment

TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION STRATEGY:
- MongoDB: Primary store for transactional data
- HBase: Real-time session and event tracking
- Spark: Distributed processing and machine learning
- Python: Integration layer and visualization

DATA FLOW:
1. Real-time: User sessions -> HBase
2. Batch Processing: Daily transactions -> MongoDB
3. Analytics: Spark processes both sources
4. Insights: Integrated dashboards and reports

BUSINESS INSIGHTS:
- High-value customers identified for loyalty programs
- Product associations discovered for bundling strategies
- Conversion bottlenecks pinpointed for UX improvements
- Seasonal trends identified for inventory planning

SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- MongoDB: Sharding for transaction volume
- HBase: Region servers for session data
- Spark: Cluster scaling for processing needs
- All components support horizontal scaling

CONCLUSION:
The multi-model approach successfully combines the strengths of:
- MongoDB's document flexibility for business data
- HBase's time-series efficiency for user behavior
- Spark's distributed processing for analytics
This provides a robust, scalable analytics platform for e-commerce.
